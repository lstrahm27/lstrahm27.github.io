            <p>Today, I dropped you off at the airport:( After that I went home and was on my computer for a while. Then I started a show called Halt and Catch Fire which is not bad, but I'll probably be watching that for a few weeks. Then I went to shoppers to get Dr. P, almond milk and some pizzas. There was this guy in front of me who had to be over 8feet tall it was crazy. He was so wide I couldn't see the other cashier waving me over. Then I came home and made pizza and chilled. I'll probably just stay in my room the rest of the night.</p>
            <p>Here we are fighting off bandits together.</p>

            <p>It's 1:20am and I finally finished the vlog, I hope. Exporting it again cuz the captions weren't displaying.</p>

            <p>That's pretty much all for tonight though, I hope I'll be awake to have you text me that you landed, but in regard to future you this is goodnight :*</p>

            <p>Heyy it's Thursday and I still havn't heard from you:/ But I'd like to show you a picture of our second bald son.</p>
            <img src="Images/fo_bald_son.PNG" class="displayimg">
            <p>I was learning some more coding shit and it was a chapter on JavaScript and it like expected me to know java which was hard but I learned a bit of it so I'm going to try it out below.</p>
            <script>
            function groovy(bg) {
                var pic;
                if (bg == 0) {
                    pic = "Images/whiteimg.png"
                } else { 
                    pic ="Images/groovy.gif"
                }
                document.getElementById("groovy").background = pic;
            }
            </script>
            <p>
                <button type="button" onclick="groovy(1)">Groovy</button>
                <button type="button" onclick="groovy(0)">Less Groovy</button>
            </p>
            <p>eyyy it worked, I hope you're proud, that took longer than I thought. Also imy especially since you havn't texted me by now.</p>

            <p>Hey there. I woke up feeling so shitty. Like I can't stop sneezing and my nose is runny but plugged at the same time. I don't know what I did to deserve this. It's hard to motivate myself, but I'm not really sure what to do, I did watch the whole first season of a show already. My goal for today is to finish the SocialSport 60s video and rate all Gabe's songs so we can choose which song to make a music video of. That's the minimum, but if I'm feeling real productive locked up in my room I want to finish all the interviews we've shot so far as well and learn some more code because I think I could get through Java by the end of the summer. On top of that I want to try to design a video or audio player. So if that's not below on this day that means I've failed.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center">
                        <audio controls="controls" preload="auto">
                    <source src="Images/lovefool.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
                    Sorry, you're not dank enough to enjoy this.
                        </audio>
                    </p>
            <p>Okay, well I did that and it was pretty easy. To fully customize it I'd need to code in a language called JQuery which I don't know ass about, so maybe I'll come back later and make it neater.</p>
            <p>I've just been working on this all day, but I finally found a system that works so that you can see it even on your phone.<br> Jerry's back now. He asked me to pick him up from the airport but I told him I'm too sick. Which I am, but I mean he can afford to take the bus once. We are gonna play some games tonight when he gets back which I'm excited for. You're probably at the movie now so hopefully I've fixed this by the time you're back. I'll keep updating it too so you can always go back to this URL to see if I've updated.<br>PS I finished most of the HTML learning so CSS is next which means I'll learn how to actually style it better and make it look all pretty for you.</p>
            <p>While waiting for Jerry I made a thing, click <a href="vlight.html" target="_blank">it</a></p>

            <p>Hello. It's saturday and I woke up at 1pm which was pretty nice. I mean at least I don't feel tired on top of everything else. I'm going to go to safeway to get groceries and new cat litter so certain PEOPLE will stop bitching.</p>
            <p> Well I went to safeway to get cat litter and food and stuff and ended up spending 70$, so I hope she's happy. Also I made a sausage and egg burrito and it was amazing. I took some niquil and am now just chilling. I canceled on Arash and of course he was like oh you're a pussy, but whatever fuck him.</p>
            <p>I just finished playing a nice game night, won a few times. But I went down stairs and ran into very drunk Austin with his tindr date lol. Sorry I don't have much for today, I'll put more effort in once I'm feeling better.</p>
